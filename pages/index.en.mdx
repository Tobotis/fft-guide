After reading this article, you should have an overview of the **Fourier-Transform** and the algorithm of the **Fast-Fourier-Transform**.
The main focus is that no assumptions are made, but that an understanding is built on the foundation of school physics/mathematics.

It is important for you to think about the content yourself and learn _actively_ by using your intuition to understand the content.
Because of this there will be small questions to think about, which look like this:


<MCQComponent
  questionData={{
    question: 'What is  $\\sin(0)$?',
    options: [
      {
        text: "0",
        isCorrect: true,
      },
      {
        text: '1',
        isCorrect: false,
      },
      {
        text: '$\\pi$',
        isCorrect: false,
      },
    ],
  }}
/>



It is ok, if you can't answer some questions, but you should always try to fully understand the correct answer.

## Notes

Additionally at times there will be some notes:

<Callout>These notes are mathmatical additions which could be helpful.</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ“š">
  These notes reference more in-depth material for further reading, but they are
  not essential for understanding the article.
</Callout>

## Appendix

The contents in the appendix are also recommended.
They are essential for understanding some of the article.
Especially the parts about [**complex numbers**](./appendix/complex-numbers/1-complex-plane) and [**complex exponentials**](./appendix/complex-numbers/2-complex-exponentials) are very recommended.
