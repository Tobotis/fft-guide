# Fourier...? An introduction
After reading this article, you should have an overview of the **Fourier-Transformation** and the algorithm of **Fast-Fourier-Transformation**.
For a better understanding there will be no preassumptions, but the goal is to build knowledge part by part on the basis of physics and mathmatics learned in school.

It is important for you to think about the contents by yourself and learn _actively_ and by using your intuition to understand the contents.
Because of this there will be small questions to think about, which look like this:

<QuestionAnswer>
  <>What is $\sin(0)$?</>
  <Answer correct={true}>$0$</Answer>
  <Answer> $1$ </Answer>
  <Answer>$\pi$</Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

It is ok, if you can't answer some questions, but you should always try to fully understand the correct answer.

## Notes

Additionally at times there will be some notes:

<Callout>
    These notes are mathmatical additions which could be helpful.

    These notes reference more in depth material for further reading, but they are not essential for understanding the article.
</Callout>


## Appendix
The contents in the appendix are also recommended.
They are essential for understanding some of the articles, but were not fitting directly in with **Fourier-Transformation**.
Especially the introduction to [**complex numbers**](./appendix/complex-numbers/1-complex-plane) and [**complex exponential functions](./appendix/complex-numbers/2-complex-exponentials) are very recommended.
