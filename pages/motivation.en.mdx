The **Fast-Fourier-Transfomation** (or **FFT**) is an algorithm for doing a specific type of **Fourier-Transfomation** very fast.
In the first part we need to understand, why the **Fourier-Transformation** even is relevant.

This article will look at the **Fourier-Series**. They give many options to research **periodic phenomens**.

By using **Fourier-Transformation** the concept of the **Fourier-Series** can also be used on non-periodic phenomens, by letting the **period duration** approach infinity.
The meaning of this is explained later.
The **Fourier-Transformation** can also be looked at and understood without the **Fourier-Series**, but in this article will first explain the **Fourier-Series** and then transition towards the **Fourier-Transformation**.

## Use-cases
There are plenty of use-cases for **Fourier-Transformation** or more specifically the **FFT**.
