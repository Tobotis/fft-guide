#Periodic functions

On the way of discovering the [**Fourier-Transform**](./3-fourier-transform) there are some stations to be looked at; for example the [**Fourier-Series**](./2-fourier-series). But as a basis the mathmatical Sine and Cosine functions will be looked at.

## Periodicity of Sine and Cosine

The very basic connection between mathmatics and **periodic phenomena** are the periodic functions of $\sin$ and $\cos$.
But why are the $\sin$ and $\cos$ periodic in the first place?
The periodicity of $\sin$ and $\cos$ is based on the rotational symmetry of a circle.
When moving on the edge of an circle, one ends up at the same point again after a while.
For a circle with a radius of $r = 1$ the cirumference is given by $U=2 \pi$. So $\sin$ and $\cos$ are periodic with a period length of $2\pi$. This lets to follow:

$$
\sin(t) = \sin(t+2\pi) \qquad \text{and}\qquad \cos(t) = \cos(t+2\pi)
$$

<Callout>
    The vertical depiction of $\cos$ is only used to make the connection to the unit circle clear. {' '}
</Callout>

A **harmonic oscillation** can therefore be created. An extensive trigonometric definition of the $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions will be left out.

## Complicated behaviour out of simple functions

### Parametervariation

There are different ways of modulating Sine- and Cosineterms, which probably are already familiar from mathmatics in school:

$$
f(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \Delta \varphi) \qquad \text{and} \qquad f(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \Delta \varphi)
$$

We have:

<br/>
<div align="center">

| Parameter        | Meaning                                                     |
| -----------------|------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\Delta \varphi$ | Phaseshifting                                               |
| $\omega$         | Angular frequency (radian per time) with $\omega = 2 \pi f$ |
| $A$              | Amplitude                                                   |

</div>

In the following example the parameters can be varied:

<QuestionAnswer>
  <>For which phaseshift $\Delta \varphi$ do we have $A \cdot \sin(\omega t + \Delta \varphi) = A \cdot \cos(\omega t)$?</>
  <Answer>$\Delta \varphi = -\frac{\pi}{2}$</Answer>
  <Answer>$\Delta \varphi = \pi$</Answer>
  <Answer correct={true}>$\Delta \varphi = \frac{\pi}{2}$</Answer>
  <Answer>$\Delta \varphi = - \pi$ </Answer>
  <Answer>There is no $ \Delta \varphi$, which lets the equation be true.</Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>
So the $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions can be broadly modified.

In the following

$$
\sin (2 \pi f t + \Delta \varphi) \qquad \text{ and }  \qquad \cos (2 \pi f t + \Delta \varphi)
$$

will be the used forms.
This holds the advantage , that the frequency $f$ can be directly seen from the equation, which allows to determine the number of periods per time span.
Thereover it is relevant to know $f=\frac{1}{T}$, with $T$ as the time per period (period length).

### Combining periodic functions
To modulate complex periodic processes, it seems intuitiv to combine multiple periodic functions.
For example a simple **addition** of the functions values could come to mind.
Multiple $\sin$-Functions could be summed.
For example:

$$
g(t) = \sin(2 \pi \cdot t) + 2 \sin (2 \pi \cdot 2t)+  \sin(2 \pi \cdot 9t)
$$

<SampleAddition />

<QuestionAnswer>
  <>Which frequency does this periodic function have?</>
  <Answer>$f= 2 Hz$</Answer>
  <Answer correct={true}>$f=1 Hz$</Answer>
  <Answer>$f=9 Hz$</Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

---

The frequency of the resulting periodic function must be the **largest common divisor** of the input frequencies, because the periodic _overall process_ can only happen, if all periodic _single processes_ repeat at the same time.

<Callout>
    The largest common divisor is the largest number, which can be used to devide two or more numbers.
    This is resembled by: $\text{ggT}(a,b)$
</Callout>

<QuestionAnswer>
  <>
    Which base frequency does the resulting periodic function have, if the component's frequencies are: $4Hz$,$6Hz$,$8Hz$?
  </>
  <Answer correct={true}>$f=2 Hz$</Answer>
  <Answer>$f=3 Hz$</Answer>
  <Answer>$f=4 Hz$</Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

In addition the phase shift of each term can be modified to, but this will not be looked at.

---

So the various components of the oscillation have frequencies, which are multiples of a certain **base frequency** $f_0$.
This **base frequency** is the frequency of the resulting periodic phenomenon, which consists of the multiple added oscillation components.

#### Introducing the Capital-sigma notation

There is a more compact notation for the addition of the Sine-Terms:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(t) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^n A_k \cdot \sin(2 \pi k  f_0  \cdot t+ \Delta \varphi_k)
\end{equation}
$$

whereas $A_k$ stands for the amplitude and $\Delta \varphi_k$ is the phaseshift of the $k$-th Sine-Term.

<Callout>
    The summation symbol $\sum_{(k = 1)}^n g(k)$ means, that the following term of $g(k)$ with all values of $k$ from $1$ to $n$ will be summed.
    This implies for example (with $g(k)=k$):  $$ \sum_{(k = 1)}^n k = 1 + 2 + ... + n $$
</Callout>


It is important, that the different frequencies $k \cdot f_0$ are natural multiples of a **base frequency** $f_0$.
The name of the function may be a little bit awkward, when discussing frequencies, which are also resembled by $f$.

Additionally the term $\frac{A_0}{2}$ is often added.
A shift on the $y$-axis is made possible by it.
This is relevant for example, when the average values of a modulated periodic phenomenon are above the $x$-axis.

<QuestionAnswer>
  <>
    How should the parameter $A_k$ of the Capital-sigma notation be chosen, to resemble the displayed function above ( $g(t) = \sin(2 \pi \cdot t) + 2
    \sin (2 \pi \cdot 2t)+ \sin(2 \pi \cdot 9t)$ )?
  </>
  <Answer>$A_k = 0$, except for $A_1 = 1, A_2 = 1,A_9 = 1$</Answer>
  <Answer correct={true}>$A_k = 0$, except for $A_1 = 1, A_2 = 2,A_9 = 1$</Answer>
  <Answer>all $A_k = 1$</Answer>
</QuestionAnswer>

Convince yourself that any sum of $\sin$ terms can be expressed by $(1)$.

### Angle sum identity

There are some notations for the **sum expression** $(1)$, which are more convienient and are more frequently used.
For solving the sum of $2 \pi k  f_0 \cdot t+ \Delta \varphi_k$ inside of the $\sin$, a relationship for the **sum of angles in a triangle** can be used:

$$
\sin(\alpha+ \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
$$

An in depth derivation of this relationship can be found at [**Sine-Angle-Sum**](../appendix/trigonometric-identities/1-sine-angle-sum).
When applying this relationship unto the **sine-term** above and expanding the equation following applies:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A_k  \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t + \Delta \varphi_k) &= A_k (\sin(2 \pi k f_0 t) \cos(\Delta \varphi_k) + \sin(\Delta \varphi_k)\cos(2 \pi k f_0 t)) \\
&= A_k \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t) \cos(\Delta \varphi_k) + A_k \sin(\Delta \varphi_k)\cos(2 \pi k f_0 t)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

To simplify this the sum can be written in the form of:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2}+ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cdot \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t ) + b_k \cdot \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t)
\end{equation}
$$

Given $a_0 = A_0$.

<QuestionAnswer>
  <>

  </>
  <Answer>$a_k = A_k \cdot \frac{\sin(\Delta \varphi_k)}{\cos(\Delta \varphi_k)}$ und $b_k = A_k \cdot \frac{\cos(\Delta \varphi_k)}{\sin(\Delta \varphi_k)}$</Answer>
  <Answer correct={true}>$a_k = A_k \cdot \sin(\Delta \varphi_k)$ und $b_k = A_k \cdot \cos(\Delta \varphi_k)$</Answer>
  <Answer >$a_k = A_k \cdot \cos(\Delta \varphi_k)$ und $b_k = A_k \cdot \sin(\Delta \varphi_k)$</Answer>
